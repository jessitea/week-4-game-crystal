<em><strong>Instructions</strong></em>

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the "Total Number".
The game will hide this amount of points until the player clicks a crystal.
Each time the player clicks a crystal, the "Total Number" will be updated.
The player wins if the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
